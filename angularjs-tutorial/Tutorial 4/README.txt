This time we’ll look at AngularJS services. 
I’ll create custom services as well as cover built in services like:
$window, $document, $location, $interval, $log, $exceptionHandler, $watch, $compile, 
and I’ll use $http to pull in data from a language translation web service. 
My translation web service was built in this tutorial.
