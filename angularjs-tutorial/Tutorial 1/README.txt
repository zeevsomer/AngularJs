Welcome to my AngularJS Tutorial. In this tutorial I clear up all of the jargon in AngularJS through a ton of examples. 
We’ll cover the Model View Controller pattern and how it works with AngularJS. 
I’ll then provide examples that explain AngularJS Modules, Directives, Scope, and Expressions.

Beyond those topics I’ll also cover:
dependency injection, ng-app, ng-init, ng-controller, ng-model, event handling, data-ng-bind, ng-repeat, 
multiple views, multiple controllers, ng-cloak, $index, $first, $last, $middle, $even, $odd, 
ng-repeat-start, ng-repeat-end, ng-include, ng-switch, ng-switch-when, ng-disabled, ng-hide, ng-show, ng-class 
and much more.
